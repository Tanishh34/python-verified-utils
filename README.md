# Python Verification Utilities

This repository contains simple Python scripts used in Design Verification
to post-process simulation and UVM scoreboard logs.

## Script: scoreboard_parser.py

- Parses transaction logs generated by UVM monitors/scoreboards
- Counts PASS/FAIL transactions
- Produces a final test summary

## How to Run

```bash
python scoreboard_parser.py
Input Log Format

Lines containing:

PASS → successful transaction

FAIL → failed transaction

Example:

UVM_INFO @ 100ns: TX_ID=1 DATA=0xA5 PASS

Sample Output

See output_example.txt

Usage in DV Flow

This script can be used after simulation to:

Quickly identify failing transactions

Generate summary statistics

Integrate with regression or CI pipelines
